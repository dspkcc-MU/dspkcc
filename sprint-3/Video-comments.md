You say you don't take good notes but I wish my players logs in Dnd were half as detailed as yours. It's cool to see how much consideration is put into
every request and how many don't even make the first cut. All those steps to ensure quality and standards are met. As for the PRs an inactive list
of contributors is a good aid in at least seeing how active a project is. People are less likely to join a project that has few contributors 
or is "dead". The discussion later about further details about inactivivty and why it could possibly have happened is something that is really sped up
with the bouncing of ideas.
