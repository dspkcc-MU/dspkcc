My goals for this project were simple for me and that was just to get SSO to work. The previous assignmnets we had for SSO I was unable to succesfully
get my program to run. The reason being some installation errors and differences on windows with commands. So I will be going along the guidlines and make an SSO
with google and see if the process is more streamlined for me. If done anyone with a google account will be able to log in.
