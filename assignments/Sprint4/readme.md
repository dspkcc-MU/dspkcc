As of right now I've manged to install and open sails in a browser. From there I'm not sure where to go from because it seems like the basics for an app already seem to installed and there's is a log-in already set in place. Also having trouble finding a useful guide to start. So now I'm looking into the code files, focusing on the script files under the contollers folder which seem to have all the codes involving login, email and password. Right now I dont see a point in uploading the project folder here as it's still the default folder 
and I havn't done any changes to the code. TAs let me know if I should upload the folder anyway for credit.

If I had figured out how to start the instuctions would be
1. npm install sails -g
2. navigate to "loginproject" folder
3. run command "sails lift"
4. open http://localhost:1337/ in a browser
5. go to login from homepage
6. sign in with X
