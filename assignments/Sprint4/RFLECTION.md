So after looking at sails and hydra I decided to go with sails mainly becasue from the UI of the website so I guess that also empahsize how 
improtant that also is when it comes to software design. Didn't seem as imposing upfront as hydra was and the setup was really simple even though
I wasted what felt like 2 hours, on setup when it was installing dependencies it just ran forever. I ended up runnning the command to
cancel those installs but it still seems to be able to function properly. I was able to make a project, lift sails and go to my local host
and see that it was indeed up. From there I was kinda at a lost as to what to do. I know the assignment was to make a login but when
sail started up it seems like it was a feature that was already in and I wasn't sure how to start the code from scratch to make my own
login and I couldn't find any relieable guides online to help me start. So for now I am looking into the code under the "controllers" folder
where all the code for login, email, and password are.
