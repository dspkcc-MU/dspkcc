Depending on the use and scale of the project my choice would vary. If it was something large scale that would be of benifit to many 
I would simply go with the MIT license. Something simple like a databse of info/tips on a game that isnt really code just data should be open
any to look at and add to. And unless it was a passion project of mine that had yet to be released something like the 3-clause BSD seems fine to me.
