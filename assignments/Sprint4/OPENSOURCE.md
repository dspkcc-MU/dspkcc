From a corp view it seems like the most cost effective way to get and maintain software and can even be a place to find new hires. For the individual
it seems like the "foot in the door" that can be entered by anyone who puts in the time. You get to look at good code and how projects are run and possibly land yourself a job.
It can be a place to market yourself where your "resume" is on display for all in the community. After reding the articles it kinda gave me the same vibe
as old school forums where anyone can join but you don't have much weight until you show contribution.
