Planned on joining Evolution group but turns out the link for that went to D&I. April 8 10am

The call was short but it was intresting to listen about badges and using bot in the process. Kinda sounded simlar to achievments in video games to me. As for the podcast it was cool listening to what goes into CHAOSS and how many companies actually use it. How many people are actually involved and are not soely linked to one are of it. The talk about standardizing was good cause that always makes things smoother.
